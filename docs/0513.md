# 边循环边重复

> 原文:[https://www.javatpoint.com/swift-repeat-while-loop](https://www.javatpoint.com/swift-repeat-while-loop)

重复 while 循环与 While 循环相同，但不同之处在于重复的主体...而在检查测试表达式之前，循环执行一次。

### 语法:

```

repeat {
    // statements
    ...
} while (testExpression)

```

在这个循环中，while 循环的重复体被执行一次，然后检查 testExpression。

### 示例:

```

var currentLevel:Int = 0, finalLevel:Int = 5
let gameCompleted = true
repeat {
    //play game
    if gameCompleted {
        print("You have successfully completed level \(currentLevel)")
        currentLevel += 1
    }
} while (currentLevel <= finalLevel)
print("Terminated! outside of repeat while loop")

```

**输出:**

```
You have successfully completed level 0
You have successfully completed level 1
You have successfully completed level 2
You have successfully completed level 3
You have successfully completed level 4
You have successfully completed level 5
Terminated! outside of repeat while loop

```
